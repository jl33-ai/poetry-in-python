### Trial 1: 
```
We can be so beautiful 
The idea that a human can look at another human being 
Despite our spectrum of subtlety and scepticism
And simply { feel âˆ© think } in 1's and 0's that: 
	I want that person, forever \inf 
	And sometimes: 
		Mean it... 
		
Breathtaking simplicity in our code. 
```
